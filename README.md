# Giftwrap!
Giftwrap is a Christmas-themed Python board game developed in under two days. Compete with a friend or a minimax algorithm to place the most gifts on the board!

(Please rate me well üôè)

## How to Play
- Take turns placing gifts on the board; CLICK on a space to place gifts.
- You can also place gifts with the ARROW KEYS and ENTER.
- Gifts must be placed adjacent to an existing gift.
- When a gift is placed, all adjacent gifts switch player possession.
- Gifts cannot be placed on ice blocks, and ice blocks cannot switch.
- The player with the most gifts on the board at the end wins!

## Installation
- Download and extract the repository ZIP to your machine.
- Run the **giftwrap.exe** file.
- You should (hopefully) have access to the game window.

Please have fun. I need to win this challenge. :)
